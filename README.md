# Stepin_Passanger-Seat-and-Heat-Monitoring-System

INTRODUCTION:
The main aim of the this case study is the button sensor will check the passenger is seated or not. By using temparature sensor we can detect the passenger is seated or not.and also the heater will check the heater button is ON or NOT.this is a very safety,comfort and conveience system for present days.in present days as technology increased people also found so many conveient ways. embedded systems are performed major role in present technologies.

FEATURES:
It is capable to determining wheather person is sitting or not by using sensors and check the heater. after that if passanger was present in the vechicle it will gives the indication. after the indication is done it will check the heat. after the indication passanger can modify the temparature by seeing the display.

SWOT Analysis-Strengths, and Weakness,Opportunities Threats:

Strengths
. Easy to change the Temparature values
. Low cost
. Easy to understand 
. Very efficient

Weakness
. Hard to keep it, you can't make any alternation

Opportunities
. it can be implemented by replacing heater by air conditioners and any other devices.

Threats
. Not suitable for high temparature environment
